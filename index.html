        <p>Troop 5592 is a Scout-led troop. We're a girls unit scout troop in the Raleigh Hills area, Oregon, founded xxxx. Scouts in our Troop come from a large geographic area.  
            We are linked with a <a href="http://troop592.net">boys group (592)</a> This gives us the advantages that come with a well established group and the
            diverse leaders that sever both units. We are adventuresome and have fun. Troop 5592 has gone on many scouting adventures such as Webelos woods, Meriwether scout camp, 
           Sledding adventures at Mt.hood, summer camp at Fire Mouintian and many more.  </p>
        <p>We welcome new members!</p>
        
        <h1>The Patrol Method:</h1>
        <p> We practice the "patrol method" with the patrol leaders leading our meetings and outings.  The older Scouts work with the younger Scouts so they learn the skills
            needed for success in Scouting and life. The troop meets weekly, camps monthly, attends summer camp, promotes high adventure trips and provides service to the community. 
        By participating in our many activities the Scouts learn Scouting values,  ethics and develop leadership skills.</p>
